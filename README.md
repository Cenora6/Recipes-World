# Recipes' World

### Description

The "Recipes' World" website gathers recipes using a free [The Meal Database](https://www.themealdb.com/). The recipes are divided based on their name, category, ingredients and area. Every recipe on the website consists of the ingredients, instructions (thanks to the marking function it's possible to save the progress of the recipe), recipe's tags and video how to prepare the dish. The blog section consists of example posts with photos, dates, post's tag, the options to like or share the blog post and the comments section with example comments.

The website is supported on every screen thanks to the RDW (responsive web design). The features changes based on the screen resolution (from mobile through tablets to computers).
